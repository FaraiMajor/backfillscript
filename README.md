# airtableAPI
This script downloads images from a specified Airtable view and uploads them as media in a WordPress instance. The user can specify the host for the WordPress website, the Airtable table and view, the maximum number of records to process, and the fields in Airtable and WordPress to use for the post title and image. The script uses the axios and fs libraries to make HTTP requests and interact with the file system, the image-downloader library to download images, and the dotenv library to manage environment variables. The script logs messages to the console as it processes records, and it exits with an error if required arguments (Airtable API key, Airtable Base ID, and WordPress password) are not provided.
